# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description
This application is designed to be a web text editor that allows a user to create notes without an internet connection. Our goal is for a user to be able to take notes, make lists, write code without access to internet, and then return to their notes at another point in time. The cache API's allow the application to be fully functional without an active internet connection.

## Usage
### Clone Repository with starter code and additions. Make sure to run "npm install" in both the main folder and within the client folder. Next, run "npm start" on the "Develop" folder in order to launch the applicaiton. Return to a browser and go to "http://localhost:3000/" in order to begin taking notes.
